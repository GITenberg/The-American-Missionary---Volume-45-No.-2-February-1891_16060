<h3>OUR LIST OF FIELD WORKERS.</h3>

<p>We present herewith our usual February list of missionaries, in church
and school, through the field of the Association. In this list many
thousands of our readers will recognize familiar names, some through
personal associations and others through their long-time acquaintance
with the work of the Association. It is no unimportant feature of the
great principle of co-operation on which our work is founded that we can
reckon upon a large force of long-tried and experienced workers in the
field. The Association has a wealth of wisdom in planning and carrying
on its work, by its ability to call into requisition the knowledge and
efforts of those who have spent many years in the South, and are
intimately acquainted with the needs, difficulties and advantages of the
work. Many individualistic schemes have failed at this point; but the
Association has developed a force that can be relied upon for the
intelligent investigation of new openings, the prudent planning of work
and its wise and steady support and development. At the same time,
associated with our older workers, we have the younger missionaries and
teachers with their fresh enthusiasm and fervent zeal, giving new
impulse of activity all along the line. This long list of names
represents years of self-denying attention and steady effort; it speaks
of large progress in the past and is the presage of still greater
progress in the future, for the list grows year by year. Our resources
and forces were never before so large as during the past year, and we
are encouraged to hope that they will be increased during the year to
come.</p>

<hr class="quarter" />

<h3>FINANCIAL.</h3>

<p>Our current receipts for December were nearly $52,000, an increase of
$11,000 over those of December, 1889. For the first quarter of our
present fiscal year the current receipts amount to $106,000, as against

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>{42}</span>

$100,000 for the corresponding period of last year. We thankfully
appreciate every enlargement of our resources, and shall continue to use
our best endeavors to keep the work within the means provided for it.
How difficult this is can be understood only by those who are in
constant receipt of numerous exigent calls for work in the great
populations among which our service lies. As a matter of record,
notwithstanding the utmost care on our part, while our receipts for this
quarter have gained $6,000 over those of last year, our expenses have
increased $12,000. We are profoundly grateful for the increasing public
interest and Christian co-operation in the work of the American
Missionary Association, and hope that the gifts of the churches will
continue to be accompanied by their counsels and their prayers.</p>

<hr class="quarter" />

<p><a name="editorial2" id="editorial2"></a></p>

<h3>THEOLOGICAL INSTRUCTION.</h3>

<p>The association is undertaking to supply the serious need, met all along
its lines of missionary service, of a more intelligent and consecrated
ministry. For the use of our Biblical Training School for the ministry,
at Fisk University, we are engaged in the erection of the building; and
the work has been taken hold of by the Fisk University Singers, who are
meeting with cheering encouragement in the churches. It is our hope
that, within the coming year, an adequate structure may be provided for
this important work.</p>

<p>The theological department at Howard University has received a valuable
accession to its faculty in the person of Prof. Ewell. This work will
now be re-classified and developed, and will offer unexcelled advantages
for practical training in preparation for the gospel ministry.</p>

<hr class="quarter" />

<h3>CONFERENCE WITH INDIAN COMMISSIONERS.</h3>

<p>The Annual Conference of the Board of Indian Commissioners with the
representatives of the various religious bodies having charge of Indian
Missions was held in the parlors of the Riggs House, January 8th. The
presence of Senator Dawes, Representative Cutcheon, and other
distinguished persons, gave weight to the deliberations, and special
interest was added to the meeting by the troubles now prevailing in the
Dakotas among the Sioux Indians. Commissioner Morgan, Captain Pratt of
the Carlisle School, General Armstrong of Hampton, and the Secretaries
of the Missionary Societies presented an array of facts and of recent
information that gave a more favorable aspect to the situation than is
generally entertained. The disturbance among the Indians is confined to
at most 5,000 among the 250,000, and strong hopes are entertained that
serious bloodshed may be avoided. And yet, so great is the uncertainty
hanging over this matter, that before these lines reach our readers, the
daily press may give sad news of battle and disaster.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>{43}</span>
The discussions of the Conference were ended with a series of
resolutions, the purport of which may thus be summed up: The Dakota
trouble is confined to a small number of Indians, and is due to the
inevitable opposition of the chiefs and anti-progressive elements among
the masses of the Indians. The removal of experienced Indian Agents for
political reasons was deprecated, and the importance of permanence in
the lines of policy pursued in the educational and Christianizing
influences was emphasized. Larger appropriations by the Government to
establish an adequate system of common-school education, until every
Indian child is enabled to attend school, compulsory education and the
continued support to contract schools, and additional facilities for
securing lands in severalty to the Indians, were endorsed.</p>

<p>The decision which it was understood the Government had made, not to
transfer the care of the Indians to the War Department, was warmly
approbated.</p>

<hr class="quarter" />

<p><a name="editorial3" id="editorial3"></a></p>

<h3>THE INDIAN PROBLEM.</h3>

<blockquote style="margin: 2em 4em">
<p>The present difficulties among the Indians in the Dakotas will
probably lead to a re-consideration of the whole system by which
the Government and the nation deals with these people. As a
contribution to that discussion, we present in condensed form some
suggestions recently published in a Boston paper, from our esteemed
friend, S.B. Capen, Esq., whose intelligent interest in the Indian
entitles his opinion to thoughtful consideration:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While public attention is everywhere called to this matter, it is time
to agitate for a radical change in the whole administration of the
Indian service. We believe that this should be disconnected entirely
from the Department of the Interior, and be made a <i>separate
department</i>. This whole Indian question is so important and so complex
that it ought not to be simply an annex to a department which has under
its control land, patents, etc. It should stand by itself; there should
no longer be a divided responsibility, which is always productive of
evil. We are finding the necessity in our cities of making
responsibility more direct and personal. The time, we believe, has fully
come to reorganize the Indian service on this basis. Our criticism is
not against any individual, but against a system which is the growth of
many years.</p>

<p>We would suggest the following;</p>

<p>1. Have the Commissioner of Indian Affairs responsible only to the
President and to the public. What he does, or may do, shall not be
controlled by the Department of the Interior.</p>

<p>2. Ask Congress to provide such legislation that no agents or teachers
shall ever be removed without proper cause.</p>

<p>3. All inspectors and special agents shall be under the absolute control
of the Commissioner.</p>


<p>4. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>{44}</span>
There shall be a division of the Indian reservation into school
districts, with an assistant superintendent for each. It shall be their
duty to visit the schools constantly, and keep themselves in full
sympathy and touch with the work. This is the method in the States&mdash;an
official responsible for a field which he can properly cover.</p>

<hr class="quarter" />

<p><a name="editorial4" id="editorial4"></a></p>

<h3>EDUCATORS' CONVENTION.</h3>

<p>The recent Educators' Convention of Atlanta was a large and significant
gathering. Such consultations of teachers carry a wide and beneficial
influence. We learn that the papers and addresses were of a high
character, and that the discussions were carried on with great interest,
and we have no doubt that the educational work throughout the South will
feel the upward impulse of this Convention.</p>

<p>We quote the following paragraph from the excellent report in the
<i>Congregationalist</i>:</p>

<blockquote style="margin: 2em 4em">
<p>
The importance of the work of the Convention may be indicated by
the topics discussed: Education in Rural Districts, Relative
Mortality of the Colored Race, Hygiene, Industrial Training, Better
Teaching in the Elementary Grades, A Scientific Course in the
College Curriculum, Compulsory Education, What Can the Negro Do?
What the Ministry is Doing to Elevate the Freedmen. A résumé was
given of the educational work of the different denominations,
mainly by the secretaries of their educational societies. The
reports of the colored Methodist churches were especially
interesting, as indicating the gratifying extent to which the
colored people are taking hold of the work of their own education.
No paper of the Convention, however, was received with such
spontaneous enthusiasm and applause as the report of Dr. Beard of
the work of the American Missionary Association. It was the
eloquence of facts. The proceedings of the Association will
constitute a large volume, which will soon be published and widely
circulated.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr class="quarter" />

<h3>"AN OPEN PATH FOR TALENT."</h3>

<p>Napoleon said this was the meaning of the French Revolution. He gave
promotion in the army not for what a man's ancestry had been, but for
what the man himself could do. Who else ever had such efficient
subordinates? Opportunities became open generally in France, according
to each one's personal ability. The excesses of the revolutionary period
were transitory. The enlargement of the nation's power, by removing the
fetters of prescription, has been permanent. The recuperative energy
displayed by France in the last twenty years is a marvelous example of
the strength imparted by liberty.</p>

<p>The educational work of the American Missionary Association in the South
makes no revolutionary disturbance. It quietly opens a path for talent
whose existence had been before unnoticed or denied. It has been already
instrumental in bringing forward many men and women to positions of
influence. Beginning with the lowest branches of education, it trained
the first colored teachers for the State school systems. Its schools
for higher education have as yet come far short of supplying the demand
for advanced teachers and for educated ministers and other educated
professional and business men.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>{45}</span>
We cannot make talent, but opening the door for talent to find
development and activity adds rich gifts to the Nation's life.</p>


<hr class="quarter" />

<p><a name="editorial5" id="editorial5"></a></p>

<h3>IRRESPONSIBLE INSTITUTIONS.</h3>

<p><i>The Independent</i>, in its Symposium of December 11th upon Gen. Booth's
Plan, has an article from Charles D. Kellogg, Superintendent of the
Charity Organization Society, in which, referring to a certain
irresponsible piece of charity, he says:</p>

<blockquote style="margin: 2em 4em"><p>
We do not believe that it is right for any one to ask for the
support of such an individual enterprise, except from those who
give it because of personal knowledge and confidence in the
manager. When the public is appealed to, such contributions take on
the nature of trust funds, the receipts and disbursements of which
should be audited and accounted for in the fullest and frankest
manner. To encourage such private, uncontrolled and unaccounted for
undertakings, is simply to open the door for any number of
conscienceless schemers who are quick to impose upon the benevolent
public.</p></blockquote>

<p>The same is true of irresponsible educational institutions. All who
receive funds for such charitable purposes, are virtually stewards of
<i>trust money</i> and ought to give an account of the same. All properties
thus developed ought to be put into a shape to be held securely and
perpetuated, and not left to become the personal possession of the
solicitors. Pious zeal and "faith" do not prevent the waste in such a
case. "Wisdom would not put cut and hammer-faced stone for the
foundation of a mountain school house, and costly glass in the windows,"
but "faith" has done this, and keeps on doing similar things.</p>

<h3>NOTES FROM NEW ENGLAND.</h3>

<p class="center">By District Secretary C.J. Ryder, Boston, Mass.</p>

<p class="center">TWO WAYS OF DOING IT.</p>

<p>"So you have come! Well! I don't know but it is just as favorable a time
as any. Still, we are in a very pinched condition. We have a debt that
we have carried for ten years and have scarcely been able to pay the
interest. The parsonage is in a desperate condition, and we are very far
from comfortable in it. Secretary Hood was here two months ago, and he
stirred the people up and took all that ought to be given to any of our
Benevolent Societies. Then, a month ago, Puddefoot was here, and you
know he sweeps in everything that can possibly be reached. I sometimes
think that he awakens too much interest, and that the churches give too
large collections. Our women are all interested in the American Board,
and will not feel like doing much for the American Missionary
Association Still, it is the time for our annual collection, and I
think no harm can come from an address on the A.M.A. work to-morrow. We
are very glad to see you."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>{46}</span></p>

<p class="center"><i>This is one way.</i></p>

<p>"How do you do, dear old friend? I declare, it seems as if I had known
you a life-time. I am ever so glad you could come and speak to my church
to-morrow. We need stirring up tremendously. Although my people are a
large-hearted, generous people, they are so much absorbed with our own
interests here, that I fear sometimes they do not appreciate the larger
work done through the Benevolent Societies. Secretary Creegan was here a
little while ago and took away a splendid collection, but he left a lot
of ripe grain to be gathered in the harvest of some other society. Then,
dear old Puddefoot came here and rattled the dry bones till he made
living men and women out of some of the skeletons. He took away one of
the largest checks that ever went from our congregation to any
benevolent cause. Secretary Maile presented the work of the College and
Education Society in such a way as to rouse the people to a sense of its
great importance. We are wonderfully glad to see you and you see are all
ready for another ingathering to-morrow. These brethren have left more
than they took away in money, and have enlarged the scope of vision of a
good many people. They see the importance and the growing needs of these
Mission fields, as never before. Put in your best blows to-morrow. Don't
be afraid that you will take anything away that ought to remain in the
community; that isn't possible. God bless you in the splendid work the
A.M.A. is doing!"</p>

<p>Now, brethren, these are two typical ways of meeting the collecting
Secretary when he calls.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Which is the better way?</i></p>

<p class="center">WHAT THE YOUNG PEOPLE AND CHILDREN ARE DOING THROUGH THE AMERICAN
MISSIONARY ASSOCIATION.</p>

<p>The readers of this department of the AMERICAN MISSIONARY magazine will
remember that some time ago the Busy Bees in the First Church in Dover,
N.H., contributed money enough to furnish the nucleus of a greatly
needed Reference Library at Gregory Institute, Wilmington, N.C. This was
the beginning of several such movements on the part of the young people
and children. The Y.P.S.C.E. of Dorchester contributed a goodly sum for
the establishment of such a library at Grand View, Tenn. A gift toward
the work in Alaska comes from the Y.P.S.C.E. at Dedham. A good many
Sunday-schools have also contributed both to the general fund and to
special objects. In Gorham, Maine, the children were greatly interested
in the Stereopticon Exhibition, which was conducted by our faithful
missionary, Rev. S.E. Lathrop. Three of them determined to give
something substantial to this work. In order to raise money, they held

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>{47}</span>

a Fair, making with their own hands many of the articles that were for
sale. This resulted in a considerable amount, which was supplemented by
a gift from the Sunday-school to constitute one of these children,
Robert Hinkley, a boy eight years of age, a Life Member of the American
Missionary Association. Is he not the youngest Life Member of our
Association? Cannot we have some letters from our friends giving the
ages of children who are Life Members? If any feel disposed to "beat the
record" by the payment of thirty dollars, they can confer this honor
upon their baby boy or girl. One baby in New England, at least, has
contributed to the work among the millions of neglected children, just
by being born. The father, a pastor of one of our churches, hands into
the treasury each year one dollar for each pound the baby weighs. When
this is known, there will be many of our missionaries who will be
praying for the health and rapid growth of that baby!</p>

<p>In Melrose, also, the "Golden Rule Mission Band" are helping our great
work, and at the same time gaining an intelligent knowledge of this
field. At the beginning of the summer one dollar and twenty-five cents
was distributed among them, each one taking five cents. This was the
seed from which they reaped a harvest of twenty-six dollars. The
following are some of the methods by which they secured this remarkable
result. One little girl bought flower-seeds and raised flowers which she
sold, and made five dollars from her five cents. Another made candy and
sold it. A little boy had a peanut stand, and one little fellow earned
his money by "going without things." Could not older people follow his
example? It suggests Thoreau's epigram, "Your wealth is measured by the
number of things you can go without;" or, better yet, Paul's magnificent
words, "poor, yet making many rich." This little fellow has hit upon the
real principle of success, whether the life is spent in a field of
active missionary work, or in "doing without things" for Christ's sake,
that His name may be proclaimed, and that His kingdom may come.</p>

<h3>CALLS FOR BOOKS.</h3>

<p>Calls often come to us from the field for hymn books. Churches or
individuals having unused books, enough of the same kind to supply a
small congregation, can get them put where they will do the most good by
sending them to our rooms prepaid.</p>

<hr class="quarter" />

<p>If any of our pastors have BARNES' NOTES in complete or incomplete sets,
which they may now no longer need, the American Missionary Association
can use them most profitably in supplying their young missionaries. Send
them to us at the Bible House.</p>

<h3>THE SOUTH.</h3>


<h4>SCHOOL AND CHURCH ITEMS.</h4>

<p>The Ballard School at Macon, Ga, is in high prosperity.</p>

<p>Straight University under its new President, Oscar Atwood, is moving
forward most hopefully.</p>

<p>A council of five neighboring churches at McLeansville, N.C., Dec., 31,
1890, ordained Brother C.C. Collins to the gospel ministry. Rev. A.W.
Curtis of Raleigh was Moderator, and Rev. A. Connet of McLeansville,
Scribe.</p>

<p>A gracious religious interest is reported from Fisk University,
Nashville, Tenn., and many hopeful conversions have gladdened the hearts
of our teachers there. The pastor of the Howard Church at Nashville,
Tenn., writes us of twenty-one conversions during Mr. Wharton's stay
with him. Six conversions are also reported at Thomasville, Ga.</p>

<p>From Knoxville, Tenn., comes this word: The labors of Mr. and Mrs.
Wharton were greatly blessed of the Lord, the hearts of Christians were
revived and twenty-six souls were brought to the knowledge of Christ. We
are very hopeful of many of the most promising and influential young
people. Our Sabbath-school has just been reorganized and a number of the
converts have been put into active service. We expect good results to
follow the work of the evangelists for a long time to come.</p>

<p>From Memphis, Tenn: Our attendance for last November ran up to the
goodly number 508. The present month will show an advance on this
number, and for January we expect to reach the 550 stage. The increase
must be confined chiefly to the night school, which is flourishing.</p>

<p>At the recent Tenth Anniversary of the Lincoln Memorial Church in
Washington, the following facts were stated:</p>

<p>The church was organized January 10, 1881, with eleven members, and its
present enrollment is 235. It has sustained a sewing-school, in which
over 400 girls have been taught. It held night schools until night
schools were opened in the public schools, and it now sustains a
kindergarten. It has sustained various branches of missionary,
temperance and charitable work. It has a flourishing Sunday-school and
senior and junior Societies of Christian Endeavor.</p>

<p>A Sunday-school superintendent in the South needs a Bible Dictionary for
the use of himself and his school. Who will send a good second-hand one
for him? We will forward it.</p>

<h3>TOUGALOO UNIVERSITY, MISS.</h3>

<p>The University of Tougaloo is most beautifully located on a plantation
of five hundred acres among great oak trees festooned with Spanish moss.
We have been having delightful weather for the past month, corresponding
somewhat to our Northern October weather.</p>

<p>It is truly pitiful to think how most of our pupils have lived before
coming here. One girl had never seen a flight of stairs before and stood
helplessly at the bottom, not knowing how to climb them: and finally
attempted to go up on her hands and knees as she had climbed a ladder.
But whatever they have been accustomed to before, they can never live
the same again after having been here.</p>

<p>The one-roomed cabin is said to be the curse of the Negro, but the white
man built it for him and it remains for him to give him a desire for
something better. The Negro is essentially religious but he fails to
connect religion and morals. When you call upon one of the old aunties,
she talks about getting religion and what a glorious thing it is, and
describes visions of heaven and hell to you in the most vivid language:
but that doesn't prevent her drinking whiskey or telling lies. I have no
doubt, however, that some of the most egregious sins of these old slaves
are less in the eyes of God than many of our smaller ones.</p>

<p>The students here carry on two literary societies and four religious
organizations, besides several little missionary societies; the King's
Daughters, the King's Sons, Young Men's Christian Association, and a
society called the Covenanters. The latter, however, have no meeting
outside of the regular Wednesday evening prayer-meeting, to which they
come prepared to take a part. This makes our Wednesday evening meetings
very interesting. It might not be a bad plan to have a body of
Covenanters in some of our Northern churches.</p>

<p>The students work hard here. There are only a very few who have money
enough to pay their expenses. They begin school at seven in the morning
and finish at half past three. They work from that time until supper and
have study hours in the evening in the school-room, so that they have
absolutely no time for recreation, and Saturdays they work all day. Many
of them teach all summer after having been in school all the year. It is
really wonderful the way many of them do and it is a great pleasure to
teach them.</p>

<p>Within the last two months we have commenced work among the churches
within four or five miles of here. Many of our older students make
excellent helpers and are so glad to go and teach in the Sunday-schools
and help their ignorant brethren in any way they can. I have never heard
one of our students express a desire to leave the South for anything
more than to complete his education. The most of them are planning to
work among their own people, teaching and carrying on trades in a way
that will be an example to the rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>{76}</span></p>

<p>Pres. Woodworth has a class composed of the pastors of the neighboring
churches, who meet him twice a week. Most of them can scarcely read a
chapter intelligently. Pres. Woodworth has taken up the Gospel of Mark
with them and is explaining it to them and showing them how to preach
from it, and they seem very appreciative, and say it is strange how long
they have misunderstood things.</p>

<p>Considering the various opportunities for work in the school and
surrounding country, one could not ask for a more satisfactory field
than Tougaloo.</p>

<p class="center">By Superintendent R.C. Hitchcock.</p>

<p>Of much interest to me is the "Circular Church" in Charleston. As early
as 1690 a wooden building was erected on the site now occupied by the
Circular church, the street being named "Meeting Street" and the
building known as the "White Meeting." Its members were Scotch
Independents and Presbyterians, with a considerable element of Huguenots
from France. For one hundred fourteen years this house was used as a
place of worship, for the first forty of which the two bodies maintained
a union, after that two churches were formed, the Independents or
Congregationalists retaining the house. In 1731 the Presbyterians
erected a wooden building on the east side of the same street, many of
the Scotch going with this body. During the Revolutionary war, while the
city was held by the British, the church was used as a storehouse and
its interior shared the fate of the Boston "Old South." Its congregation
was composed of both white and colored members, but only "freemen" could
vote in meeting.</p>

<p>The Civil War with its results, effected a separation of the white and
colored members, the white people rebuilding their lecture-room, the
colored worshiping in various places until 1867, when a letter was sent
the old church by a number of the former members, requesting an
honorable dismissal. This was granted and one hundred eight colored
people presented themselves for membership in a church contemplating
organization, as a Congregational church, to be called</p>

<div class="center">PLYMOUTH CHURCH.</div>

<p>This organization was consummated April 14, 1867, under the auspices of
the American Missionary Association. And in 1872 a suitable edifice was
erected on Pitt Street at a cost of $5,000. The present pastor, Rev.
Geo. C. Rowe, is much beloved by his people.</p>

<p>A tasteful parsonage is being erected on the church lot. It was greatly
needed. Plymouth Church is reaching out in schools and missions among
the colored people with earnest efficiency.</p>

<h4>OUR HOSPITAL AT FORT YATES, N.D.</h4>

<p class="center">By the Physician in Charge, Cynthia E. Pingree, M.D.</p>

<p>I am sure that all will be glad to hear a word about the hospital for
Indians, especially as there is nothing but good news to tell.</p>

<p>This hospital has now been built about two years. It will seem very
small when I tell you that it has but two wards, containing three cots
each, a bath-room, dispensary, reception room, doctor's and nurse's room
and dining room; and yet when the patient comes to us, he feels that we
have not only every convenience, but a great many luxuries, and from
this little Woasui Tipi or House of Healing, goes out many a ray to
gladden the hearts of those whom we to-day are trying to bring from
darkness into light.</p>

<p>But little has been done for these people when ill, except conjuring,
which is synonymous with torturing, but these "medicine men" are losing
their hold upon the faith of those who at one time, and that not long past,
trusted them fully, and the more intelligent ones gladly avail themselves
of treatment. And no class of people needs it more, the filthy manner in
which they live causing much sickness. It has been a great surprise to me
as well as to them, to see how much simple cleanliness will do in very many
of these cases. The old rule, "remove the cause, the disease is removed,"
holds true in these cases. It is encouraging to see how soon some of these
come to see the great importance of this.</p>

<p>I have in mind now a bright little boy nine years old, who was brought
to me wrapped in filthy old rags, unable to take one step on account of
terrible sores, which had received no attention whatever. The mother's
heart was very sad as she told me this was the only boy she had, five
having died. All the while I was attending to the little fellow the
mother carefully watched. She was given all that was necessary to use
for two weeks and when they returned, at the end of that time, it was
very evident that the boy had received good care. The mother cared for
him almost entirely after this, and in two months he came <i>running</i>
across the prairie, his braided hair just flying, asking for a piece of
bread. While the child was not cured, he had been made comfortable, the
parents' hearts had been lightened of a great sorrow, and they had
learned more than one lesson in thus caring for their child.</p>

<p>This is only one of many cases. Until they feel their illness is
well-nigh fatal they prefer the tent to the hospital, and even then a
great many wish to die out of doors. So that often the family come with
the ill one and camp just outside the yard. The hospital wards bring
comfort to two classes principally; the more civilized Indian, who

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>{78}</span>

realizes the great benefit derived from good nursing, and those
friendless ones who are brought because they are too much trouble
elsewhere. Both of these classes are very grateful for all they receive.
The dispensary is open all the time and a great many are provided with
medicine. I think the friends of this Hospital may be of good cheer.</p>

Care, however, should be taken to designate the money as for the

<h3>LETTERS TO THE TREASURER.</h3>

<p>"In sending my last subscription to the American Missionary Association
I supposed it to be my last. But the dear Master has not only
spared me hitherto, but he has given me the privilege of sending to the
Society another token of my continued love. You will find draft for
$1,000 enclosed. I am unable to write more. The Lord abundantly bless
and prosper this beloved Society in its noble work."</p>

<p>A friend in Vermont sends $2 and would gladly give more but has
invested about $1,000 in Iowa lots and stock "from which I hoped to get
some profitable honest gain. It has only yielded disappointment. I still
pray the Lord to bless your work&mdash;a sure investment&mdash;and to help me to
become a better helper in the good work."</p>

<p>A friend in Ohio, with $20, says: "I have read the minutes, papers and
addresses of your last meeting with <i>thrilling interest</i>. I hope they
may be widely circulated and thoughtfully and generally read.</p>

<p>Our Annual Report is now ready for distribution. Those who wish it
will please send us a postal card requesting it.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
